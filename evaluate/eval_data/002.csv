Arithmetic is an elementary branch of mathematics that is widely used for tasks ranging from simple day-to-day counting to advanced science and business calculations.
"Algebra is one of the main branches of mathematics, covering the study of structure, relation and quantity. Algebra studies the effects of adding and multiplying numbers, variables, and polynomials, along with their factorization and determining their roots. In addition to working directly with numbers, algebra also covers symbols, variables, and set elements. Addition and multiplication are general operations, but their precise definitions lead to structures such as groups, rings, and fields."
"Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.  In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying ""smoothly"", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers,  graphs, and statements in logic[1] – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values.[2] Discrete mathematics, therefore, excludes topics in ""continuous mathematics"" such as calculus and analysis. Included below are many of the standard terms used routinely in university-level courses and in research papers. This is not, however, intended as a complete list of mathematical terms; just a selection of typical terms of art that may be encountered. For further reading in discrete mathematics, beyond a basic level, see these pages. Many of these disciplines are closely related to computer science."
"Trigonometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the relationships between the sides and the angles in triangles. Trigonometry defines the trigonometric functions, which describe those relationships and have applicability to cyclical phenomena, such as waves. Uses of trigonometry Trigonometric identity "
"Logic  is the formal science of using reason and is considered a branch of both philosophy and mathematics and to a lesser extent computer science. Logic investigates and classifies the structure of statements and arguments, both through the study of formal systems of inference and the study of arguments in natural language. The scope of logic can therefore be very large, ranging from core topics such as the study of fallacies and paradoxes, to specialized analyses of reasoning such as probability, correct reasoning, and arguments involving causality. One of the aims of logic is to identify the correct and incorrect inferences."
